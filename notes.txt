how do you read the current url? : window.location.href

can you take an action when a url is entered and tries to navigate internally?

things to figure out:
- routing : router.js file with switch on router variable. get url and view is changed.
- state management : export state variable
- form handling
- templating : pages folder with templage files. returns template literal.
